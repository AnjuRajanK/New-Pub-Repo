    <description>This field is optional. This is a semicolon-delimited list of roles that are allowed to view and download a specific document, as well as copy its URL and view its version history. If left blank, all roles can view and download the document, as well as copy its URL and view its version history. This field works in tandem with the older Viewer Roles field, which is limited to fewer characters.</description>
