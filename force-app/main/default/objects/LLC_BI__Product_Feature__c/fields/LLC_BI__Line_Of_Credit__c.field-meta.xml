    <description>This field is manually selected. When enabled, this product feature specifies that a product is a line of credit. This flag is used to override the relationship stats criteria &quot;UsePrincipalBalance=true&quot;, so that a line of credit product always uses &quot;Original Amount&quot; for exposure calculations. Additionally, the LLC_BI__Current_LTV__c on Loan uses Original Amount for its calculation. When disabled, the relationship stats criteria is not overwritten, and an exposure calculation with &quot;UsePrincipalBalance=true&quot; criteria will use the principal balance. Similarly, LLC_BI__Current_LTV__c will use principal balance for its calculation. By default, this is disabled.</description>
