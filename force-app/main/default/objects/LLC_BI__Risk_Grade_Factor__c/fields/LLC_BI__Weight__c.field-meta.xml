    <description>This field is required. It must be manually populated with a percentage number lower than 1 (ex: .25). It is used to determine how much a particular risk grade factor contributes to a risk grade group (if the factor is associated to a group) or the calculated risk grade (if it does not). The weight across all risk grade factors for a group (if associated) or a risk grade template (if no group) should not exceed 1.</description>
